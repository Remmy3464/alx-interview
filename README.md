# Pascal Triangle Algorithm
This repository contains a Python implementation of an algorithm to generate a Pascal triangle.

A Pascal triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers in which the top row consists of a single 1, and the values in each subsequent row are the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of a Pascal triangle might look like this:

Copy code
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
This pattern continues indefinitely, with each row containing one more element than the previous row.

The implementation includes a function pascal_triangle(n) that takes in a single argument, n, which specifies the number of rows to generate in the Pascal triangle. It prints out the resulting triangle to the console.

To use the implementation, simply call the pascal_triangle() function with the desired number of rows. For example, calling pascal_triangle(5) would generate the first five rows of the Pascal triangle shown above.

I hope you find this implementation useful! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
